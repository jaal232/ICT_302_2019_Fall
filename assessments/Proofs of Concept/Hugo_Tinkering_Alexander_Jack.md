# What Changes Did You Make?
I was not able to see any actual changes that i made work. But i was trying to change to the text color and could not quite figure it out. I would have like to figure out how to change the font color as well as change the theme. We explored some Hugo themes and i would have like to have gotten one of those to work. 

# What Did You Learn?
Learning about Hugo and how to use it has helped me learned more about how beneficial content management systems are. Having a code for a website can be alot to handle but with these systems it helps to keep it organized. These management systems make working with code much easier.
