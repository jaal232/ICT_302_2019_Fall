# Similarities
Looked at the presidental campaign sites of Donald Trump, Joe Biden and Mark Sanford which were all made using Wordpress. They all have one big background image that doesnt change as you scroll down the page. They all have logins or places to sign up and that seems to be the main focus of the pages. They all have very little information on the main page. They are mainly focus around having a place where you can click to make donations or sign up/login to the site. All three domain names are the candidates name in the URL. 

# Differences
Donald Trump and Joe Bidens site are almost identical. The main difference is that Trump's page has a bigger section for donations with a slightly differnet design. The layout is basically the same but the design is the big difference. With Mark Sanford's website, he has alot more content on the home page with a few videos of him speaking and more options of where to click to navigate away from the home page.
