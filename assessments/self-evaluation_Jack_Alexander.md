# Course Objectives

Throughout the semester, the following “I can” statements have served as guiding objectives for this course. Now that we're at the end of the semester, you should feel comfortable making each statement about yourself and be able to back up that statement with your performance on course activities and assessments. Because of the important role that the CMS Guidebook has played in our course, and because of the unstructured nature of this assignment, please concentrate in particular on your contributions to that project as you evaluate yourself according to course objectives.

## I can identify and define key concepts in (web) content management.

> Take a few minutes on what it means to identify and define key concepts in (web) content management and why this course objective is important. Summarize your thoughts below: 

Understanding the concepts of web and content management are key in understanding how to use them. Understanding the concpets helps you understand how to properly identify them on the web and understnad how to properly use them when managing your content or just putting it out on the web in general. 

> Consider specific moments (such as interactions with Dr. Greenhalgh or your classmates) or activities (such as assessments you submitted or contribution you made to the CMS Guidebook) during the semester that would give some insight into your ability to identify and define key concepts in (web) content management. In the space below, identify at least two moments or activities and (for each) describe what they say about your ability to meet this course objective. Please be as specific as possible (such as quoting exact text from your learning journal, identifying an edit to the CMS Guidebook in WordPress, or quoting from a particular conversation in Slack).

One activity we did in class that really helped me understand some key concepts was when we all listed our favorite websites and then we went through each of them and figured out how they profited from the site. Basically how the site generate revenue and what the pupose of it was. Some websites make money off subscrpitions, some ads, etc. From my site i said snapchat and how it is a free service to use so they have to make all of their money from ads. These concepts are important when thinking about what type of website you want yours to be. 

Another another in-class actvity that helped me with concept indetntification was when we split into groups and were each assigned a different website to review. We then went around the class and pointed out key things that website does well and what they have included that gives them an advantage over other sites. For example, the way the site was created (Wordpress, Wix, etc.) and key things the site includes like a search bar, subscriptions, comments sections, some aspect of social media, etc. 

> Based on your comments above, rate yourself on this ability on a scale of 0-8, and summarize why you gave yourself that number.

For this section i believe i should recieve an 8. Identifying the concepts was one of the overall main things we focused on in this class and it is something i got alot better at as the semester went on. It was difficult to just talk about concepts in the powerpoints but when we actually did hands-on activities, i believe identifying concepts within active websites was something i was pretty good at. 

## I can manage content using established workflows.

> Take a few minutes on what it means to manage content using established workflows and why this course objective is important. Summarize your thoughts below:

Workflows are an important key in almost all comapanies and technologies, as well as with content management systems. Without workflows content would have no meaning and it would make no sense. Workflows are key especially when working within a group or collaborating with others. Workflows relate to the way and order things are done so that everything runs smothly, efficiently, and properly within our CMS.

Please be as specific as possible (such as quoting exact text from your learning journal, identifying an edit to the CMS Guidebook in WordPress, or quoting from a particular conversation in Slack).

Workflows have been very important in this class. For the CMS i was incharge of doing chapter 3 which is about Github. For this secontion i had to pay close attention to the workflows of Github so that everyone can understand properly how to use github. I had to start by discussing text ediotrs, then discuss atom which is the specific editor we learned about for this class, markdown and then finally expalin what Github is and how it collaborates with everything. If i did not pay attention to the workflows here then it would be very hard to follow along and understand Github and the whole CMS GUidebook page.

The CMS Guidebook as a whole has to be properly formatted in terms of workflows. The guidebook starts with table of contents and ends with the glossary. If the guidebook were not formatted in the proper workflows order then it would look very unorganized and it would be impossible to follow along with and understand. 

> Based on your comments above, rate yourself on this ability on a scale of 0-8, and summarize why you gave yourself that number.

In terms of workflows i would rate myself an 8. I feel i fully captured the proper order of workflows when it comes to the github chapter with the text editors, atom, markdown and github as well as the CMS guidebook as a whole. Workflows have been easy to understand thanks to the way this class has been laid out.  

## I can identify and employ technologies related to content management.

> Take a few minutes on what it means to identify and employ technologies related to content management and why this course objective is important. Summarize your thoughts below:

Technologies relates to content managment are very important especially for this class. Within the CMS systems themselves there are other technologies like communication systems. These systems are important for things such as setting deadlines and communicating and collaborating with other group members. Familiarizing yourself with all possible technologies related to the CMS you are using is a huge advantage in work and workflow.

In the space below, identify at least two moments or activities and (for each) describe what they say about your ability to meet this course objective. Please be as specific as possible (such as quoting exact text from your learning journal, identifying an edit to the CMS Guidebook in WordPress, or quoting from a particular conversation in Slack).

In this class we used multiple technologies related to content management. One of my favorite things we explored was Github. There are tons of things you can do with Github that makes your job easier. You can collaborate with millions of people within or your company or outside of it. You all use the same code and everyone has the option to make improvments on the code without it effecting others until it is ready. You also have numerous options for oganizing content for your websites, documents, files, etc. so that it is easy to understand and you are not stuck with a huge HTML file to work with. 

I also worked alot with Slack which was enjoyable and made communication so easy. This was the way we communicated for the CMS guidebook so that we knew where to find the google.doc, as well as any questions we may have that can be answered by fellow group members. We also used Slack to know when our deadlines were for the CMS Guidebook as well as any updates about due dates. Slack was a great way of communicating for our group for the final CMS guidebook project. 

> Based on your comments above, rate yourself on this ability on a scale of 0-8, and summarize why you gave yourself that number.

In terms of indentifying technologies within and related to content management i would give myself an 8. Doing chapter 3 in the CMS guidebook i believe i fully understood Github and all the technologies related to it as well as within it. I also had to do much work with slack and clickup as these were the editors group primary line of communication as well as for setting deadlines. 

## I can find and use resources for self-directed learning

> Take a few minutes on what it means to find and use resources for self-directed learning and why this course objective is important. Summarize your thoughts below:

Self-directed learning is very important in this class and all technology based classes because we are working with and learning about the web and web system that we use everyday. Some form of CMS systems are in almost all of the websites and apps we use everyday. Canvas is a CMS system, Twitter is a CMS system, using self-directed learning in relation to these apps and websites we use everyday helps us to understand how to use them better and how to relate these to our real life.

Please be as specific as possible (such as quoting exact text from your learning journal, identifying an edit to the CMS Guidebook in WordPress, or quoting from a particular conversation in Slack).

When we explored text editors we talked about atom which we had to download and use for a basic webpage assignment. Since i was already familiar with that text editor from the assignment i used that text editor for all of my other ICT classes and ended up doing alot of HTML and PHP work with it. I expanded my previous knowledge on this text editor and used it beyond the classroom for my other assignment. 

Once our editors group became familiar with slack, we ended up using it for alot. Since we were already so familiar with it and it is so easy to use and such a good form of group/class communication, we used it for things like peer review assingment and just to chat. If it werent for this then the final CMS guidebook assignment probably would have been a disaster. 

> Based on your comments above, rate yourself on this ability on a scale of 0-8, and summarize why you gave yourself that number.

In terms of self-directed learning i would give myself an 8 because i believe this is a concept i grasped well from this course. Most all of the assignments were related to some system that we use everday, like twitter, so understanding these concepts has helped me to implement them in my systems that i use everyday. 

## I can describe and compare content management systems.

> Take a few minutes on what it means to describe and compare content management systems and why this course objective is important. Summarize your thoughts below:

Being able to describe and compare content management systems is very important. If you cant do this then you do not truly understand what makes them unique and helpful and you do not understand what seperates one from another. Each CMS system has its strengths and weaknessess so understading what these are is extremely important depending on what you are using them for.

> Consider specific moments (such as interactions with Dr. Greenhalgh or your classmates) or activities (such as assessments you submitted or contribution you made to the CMS Guidebook) during the semester that would give some insight into your ability to describe and compare content management systems. In the space below, identify at least two moments or activities and (for each) describe what they say about your ability to meet this course objective. Please be as specific as possible (such as quoting exact text from your learning journal, identifying an edit to the CMS Guidebook in WordPress, or quoting from a particular conversation in Slack).

We did multiple assignments comparing different systems. We needed to understand the benefits of each system so that we knew which system to use and when for the final CMS guidebook project. We explored systems like Hugo and Hithub and came to the conclusion of which one we liked and which one we didnt. We explored Wordpress with wix and other systems and saw that we wanted to use Wordpress for the final project because it was the easiest and most familiar. 

Comparing and contrasting is very key when understanding what you are going to be using them for. When we look at slack versus clickup, we decided we wanted to use slack more as a form of communication, and use clickup more as a form of setting dealines and assigning people chapters. 

> Based on your comments above, rate yourself on this ability on a scale of 0-8, and summarize why you gave yourself that number.

In terms of being able to compare and contrast content managment systems i would give myself an 8 as this is something that we have practiced frequently throughout the semester. As a class we have worked through comparing different systems and deciding which is best to use for our final CMS guidbook project. This has helped me as an individual fully grasp the concept. 

# Final Grade

> Add together your 0-8 ratings to get a final, overall rating between 0-40. Write that number below, and provide an overall summary of why you think this number reflects your performance in this class.

Total: 40
I believe that through the assignments, workflows, and overall design of this class i have fully grasped the concpets above. The asignments and final project have made it so that you have no choice but to use the systems in a very hands on way for the final CMS Guidebook assignment. Throughout the semester we learned about the differnt CMS's as well as their positives and negatives and all concepts related with them. We then had to use the systems ourselves and get a first hand look at everything we previously learned about and we got to see these systems and concepts in play for ourselves. Through the layout of the course and information provided within it, i believe i have fully grasped all of the objectives within the course.
