# What Is Being Done?

I am responsible for creating and editing the content in the github section of the CMS guidebook. Within that section i will discuss github, markdown, atom and tect editors. I will cover all the information required to fully understand how to operate and use github and other text editors. 

# When Is It Being Done?

I aimed to have all sections done at a timely manner and no later November 15th. I have completed all sections and marked them as complete in the class clickup page. I completed all sections and covered all the required material by the designated time. 

# How Will It Be Evaluated?

My work can be evaluated based on covering the required information. A point or two could be given for the completion of each section and covering the required material that is needed for fully understanding the section. The biggest thing in evaluating would be making sure that all the requird information and material is there so that anyone reading could understand it. 

# Who Will Evaluate It?

Anyone in the editors group would be a good fit to evaluate my work. They would just need a small understand of github and text editors. If they can fully understand how to use github, atom, markdown and other text editors from reading my section of the CMS guidebook then it should be good.
