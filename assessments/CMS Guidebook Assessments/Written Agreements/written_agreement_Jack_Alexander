# What Is Being Done?

> I will be incharge of creating and editing the section about Github. I will be responsible for this section and will approve and edit any information in this Github section. There are several sub-sections within this Github section, such as mark-down, repositories, pull-requests, etc.

# When Is It Being Done?

> I will begin completing these tasks this week. I will start by completing the markdown section because i believe this is one of the most important so i want to focus the most time on this section. After that i will complete tasks in order of importance to understand what Github is and how to use it. 

# How Will It Be Evaluated?

> The colleague that you name below will be assessing your work throughout the semester with a total of eight points. Describe the standards that your colleague should use and the considerations they should make when deciding how many of those points you will earn.

# Who Will Evaluate It?

> Sam Carmack. This can be evaulated by anyone in the editor group. I feel the best way to evauluate would be just based off making sure all the appropriate information in there. Github is a big section with many important subsections so we need to ensure that all the important topics are covered in depth.
